# pokemon
## Gotta SELECT em all

This demo file contains a csv file listing 700+ pokemon

The file called makeDatabase.py takes that csv and creates a database file. You should only need to run this once.

The file main.py takes that database file and lets you experiment with SQL commands to SELECT,UPDATE, DELETE records, or INSERT new ones.

Can you create a second table called "Pokedex", to contain the pokemon that a player has caught?
